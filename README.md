### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a versatile software developer with a strong background in full-stack development, system integration, and cybersecurity. My repositories showcase a range of projects, from building interactive dashboards using Python and Streamlit to developing full-stack solutions with Springboot and React. I enjoy working on practical applications that bridge the gap between technical complexity and user-friendly solutions.
<br><br>
Here, you'll find some of my recent work:
<br><br>
Cybersecurity Dashboard: A Streamlit-powered dashboard that visualizes cybersecurity incident data.<br>
Python Games: A collection of games developed in Python, focused on interactive gameplay and clean code.<br>
Tkinter Dashboard: A user-friendly Python dashboard built with Tkinter for quick data visualization.<br>
<br><br>
