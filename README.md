### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a vocational instructor in application development where I introduce young adults to their first steps in programming.<br/><br/>
This is my GitHub portfolio. I take pride in my work and am thus using it to showcase my projects I create as part of bootcamps or other self-learning methods.
Feel free to get in touch if you see a business opportunity for us to work on together!
