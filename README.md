### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ajita Gupta, a vocational instructor and software engineer with a passion for teaching application development and building robust software solutions. With over 5 years of experience in Java, Python, SQL, and web development, I train young adults in their programming journey, while constantly honing my own skills through various self-learning projects and bootcamps.
<br/><br/>
This GitHub portfolio showcases my work across diverse projects, ranging from real-time stock market data streaming to student management systems. Each project reflects my dedication to writing clean, efficient code, whether itâ€™s part of my teaching role or personal learning.
<br><br>
I believe in continuous growth, and Iâ€™m always open to exploring new collaborations or business opportunities. Feel free to connect!
